# Vitrual-Paitbrush-using-Hand-Gesture-Detection
An application made by utilizing OpenCV and the Mediapipe framework to track finger movements in real time by detecting hand landmarks. The application can distinguish between the selection gesture and the drawing gesture, which allows users to draw, erase, and create geometric shapes on a digital canvas without any physical contact.

### Tools and Technology
* Python: The main language for development
* OpenCV: Used for image processing, video capture, and bitwise canvas operation
* MediaPipe: For extracting the 21 hand landmarks of the hand
* NumPy: Used for performing matrix operations and digital canvas handling

### Key Features
* Real-time hand tracking
* Gesture logic
* Canvas Rendering
* Shape Generation

### Setup Instructions
* Make sure the Python version is 3.10 (MediaPipe has compatibility issues with recent versions)
